# RdRpCATCH
## RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Collaborative Analysis Tool with Collections of pHMMs

** Forked from https://github.com/dimitris-karapliafis/RdRpCATCH **  
** Modifying to use [rolypoly](https://code.jgi.doe.gov/UNeri/rolypoly) code/approaches **

RdRpCATCH is collaborative effort to combine various publicly available RNA virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase pHMM databases in one tool
to facilitate their detection  in (meta-)transcriptomics data.


RdRpCATCH  is written in Python and uses the pyHMMER3
library to perform pHMM searches. The tool scans each sequence in the input file with the selected databases and provides the 
hit with the highest bitscore across all databases as the best hit. In addition, the tool provides information about the number of profiles
that were positive for each sequence across all databases, and taxonomic information based on the MMseqs2 easy-taxonomy and search modules against a custom RefSeq Riboviria database.

## Installation

### Installation instructions for testing phase

RdRpCATCH will be available as a bioconda package soon. For the testing phase, we provide a tarball and a .yaml file to
install the tool and its dependencies. The .tar.bz2 is created for Linux systems but should work on MacOS as well.
(Windows is not supported)

#### Prerequisites
For the installation process, conda is required. If you don't have conda installed, you can find instructions on how to
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html  
Mamba is a faster alternative to conda. If you have it installed, you can use it instead of conda.  

#### Installation steps
Download the this repo and navigate to it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimitris-karapliafis/RdRpCATCH.git
cd RdRpCATCH
```
Create the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f meta_4test.yaml -n rdrpcatch
```

Activate the environment and download the RdRpCATCH databases:

```bash 
conda activate rdrpcatch
rdrpcatch download --destination_dir path/to/store/databases
```

* Note 1: The databases are large files and may take some time to download (~ 5.5 GB).
* Note 2: The databases are stored in the specified directory, and the path is required to run RdRpCATCH. The path that 
needs to be provided has to be accompanied by the directory DBs, e.g., path/to/store/databases/DBs

## Usage
RdRpCATCH can be used as a CLI tool as follows:

```bash 
# make sure the conda environment is activated
# conda activate rdrpcatch

# scan the input fasta file with the selected databases
rdrpcatch scan -i path/to/input.fasta -o path/to/output_dir -db_dir path/to/database
```
### input: 
The input file can be one or more nucleotide or protein sequences in multi-fasta format. 
The output directory is where the results will be stored. We recommend specifying the type of the sequence in the command line,
An optional argument `--seq_type` (nuc or prot) can be used to specify if the input fasta file sequences are nucleotide or amino acid.

The following two commands are available in RdRpCATCH:  
* [`rdrpcatch scan`](#rdrpcatch-scan)

##TODO:
- [ ] loud logging is linking to the utils.py file, not the actual line of code causing the error.
- [ ] Add `overwrite` flag
- [ ] verify plots are working
- [ ] verify gff output is working
- [ ] drop `db_dir` argument and use global/environment/config variable that is set after running the `download` command
